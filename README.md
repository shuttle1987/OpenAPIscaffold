# OpenAPI project scaffolding

Project scaffolding for Open API projects using Flask

This helps you set up the requisite Flask configuration to host an OpenAPI defined API.

## Usage

This scaffolding uses [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for creating an API project from a template. You will need a recent version of cookiecutter installed (>=1.6.0) to ensure all features of this work.

Before you start make sure you install cookiecutter:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

This project template can be used directly from GitHub like so:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:shuttle1987/OpenAPIscaffold
```

To use this project template:

```bash
cookiecutter /path/to/template
```

Then fill in some metadata about your project and then check out your newly created project files.
